    """A unit of change that can be undone and redone.

    In here, we store changes that happened to a document in the form of sets containing instances.
    These set's are not documented individually to reduce verbosity, but there's 3 types (``added``,
    ``changed`` and ``deleted``) of sets for each supported instance (``accounts``, ``groups``,
    ``transactions``, ``schedules``, ``budgets``).

    For ``added`` and ``deleted``, it's rather easy. The set contains instances directly. For
    ``change``, it's different. The set contains 2-sized tuples ``(instance, backup)``. Whenever
    we're about to make a change to something, we copy it first and store that backup. Then, when
    we undo our action, we can use our backup.

    To create an action, you can operate on set attributes directly for ``added`` and ``deleted``,
    but you should use convenience method for ``changed``. They perform the copying for you.
