        A balanced transaction has all its splits making a zero sum. Balancing a transaction is
        rather easy: We sum all our splits and create an unassigned split of the opposite of that
        amount. To avoid polluting our splits, we look if we already have an unassigned split and,
        if we do, we adjust its amount instead of creating a new split.
        
        There's a special case to that rule, and that is when we have two splits. When those two
        splits are on the same "side" (both positive or both negative), we assume that the user has
        just reversed ``strong_split``'s side and that the logical next step is to also reverse the
        other split (the "weak" split), which we'll do.
        
        If ``keep_two_splits`` is true, we'll go one step further and adjust the weak split's amount
        to fit what was just entered in the strong split. If it's false, we'll create an unassigned
        split if needed.
        
        Easy, right? Things get a bit more complicated when a have a
