class Lookup:
    """Fuzzily-filtered list of items that match the few letters that the user typed.

    A Lookup allows the user to quickly find a object he looks for by name by typing only a few
    letters from that name. When first invoked, we start with a list of all possible items, and as
    letters are typed, those items and filtered *and* ordered in a way that fuzzily matches what
    our user typed.

    The list's filter is very inclusive and will include object that very remotely can match user's
    input, but the order is based on what matches the most.

    For example, if the user types "ab", the lookup list would contain both "barber", "absolute", 
    and "albinos" (all those names contain both "a" and "b"), but would be ordered so that
    "absolute" comes first because it's the closest match.

    Pressing Return will "activate" (see :meth:`go`) the first item in the list, but the user can
    also navigate the list with the arrow keys (or click on the wanted item), which is why we keep
    track of :attr:`selected_index`.

    This class is designed to be subclassed with concrete named objects to lookup in. It does
    nothing by itself.
